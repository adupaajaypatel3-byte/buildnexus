# BuildNexus — Prototype


This is a simple static prototype demonstrating BuildNexus features. To run locally:


1. Place files in a folder buildnexus.
2. Open index.html in your browser.


### Deploy to Vercel


1. Push this folder to GitHub.
2. Sign in to vercel.com and import the repository.
3. Set framework to Other (Static) if prompted — root contains index.html.
4. Deploy.

## Next steps (I can implement):


- Add backend API (Node/Express or Next.js API routes) for real estimations and contractor DB.
- Connect to a database (Postgres or Firebase) and add user accounts.
- Integrate an AI estimation model (server-side) or call an LLM to generate CDM/RAMS.
- Add authentication (Magic.link / Auth0) and billing (Stripe).


Tell me which piece to build next and I will scaffold it.
